# A English poem #课程


**No** man is an island,

entire of itself;

every man is a piece of the continent,

a part of the main;

**if** a clod be washed away by the sea,

Europe is the less,

as well as if a promonroty were,

<u>as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were;</u>

**any** man's death diminishes me,

because I am involved in mankind,

and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;

it tolls for thee.
